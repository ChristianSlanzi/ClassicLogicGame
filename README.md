# ClassicLogicGame
A repo to collect and to investigate ideas for creating Classic Logic Games for iPhone.

The idea is to create a flexible game logic engine (or multiple engines if necessary) and some games on top of them.

Primary focus will be on the logic and less on the graphic.

To create a game logic engine we should start defining some concepts.

# what is a classic logic game?

Classic Logic games may refer to Logic Puzzles, Quizzes, Board games, Card games... Those are games with limited and very well defined rules and a way of termination either by victory, defeat or in some cases also an equal draw could be possible.

Game: A play between 1 or multiple players.
Rules: A series of logical conditions.
Victory/Defeat/Draw conditions:  determine the end of the game.
Turn based: A player will be able to play its "move" when the previous player is done.
